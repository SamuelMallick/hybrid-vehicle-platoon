This repository contains the source code used to produce the results obtained in [A Comparison Benchmark for Distributed Hybrid MPC Control Methods: Distributed Vehicle Platooning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09878) submitted to [IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology](https://ieeecss.org/publication/transactions-control-systems-technology).

In this work, we propose a benchmark control problem for evaluating distributed hybrid model predictive controllers. The benchmark problem is the control of a platoon of vehicles, with the vehicle dynamics modelled as a hybrid system. We present two modelling approaches and evaluate five existing hybrid model predictive controllers on the benchmark.

## Installation

The code was created with `Python 3.11`. To access it, clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SamuelMallick/hybrid-vehicle-platoon
cd hybrid-vehicle-platoon
```

and then install the required packages by, e.g., running

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Structure

The repository code is structured in the following way

- **`env.py`** contains the environment for simulating the platoon. This updates the state of the platoon according to the nonlinear hybrid model, and generates the cost penalties for given states.
- **`model.py`** contains all functions and data structures related to the modeling of the vehicles.
- **`data`** contains '.pkl' files for data used in A Comparison Benchmark for Distributed Hybrid MPC Control Methods: Distributed Vehicle Platooning.
- **`results_analysis`** contains scripts for generating the images and tables used in A Comparison Benchmark for Distributed Hybrid MPC Control Methods: Distributed Vehicle Platooning.
- **`fleet_{cent_mld, decent_mld, seq_mld, event_based, naive_admm}.py`** launch simulations for the five controllers used in A Comparison Benchmark for Distributed Hybrid MPC Control Methods: Distributed Vehicle Platooning.
- **`utils`** contains auxillary scripts used in the project.
- **`mpcs`** contians base MPC classes upon which the five controllers are built.
- **`misc`** contains classes used in simulations to generate reference trajectories, spacing policies, and specify simulation details.
